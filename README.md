<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Clarozen-clothing is an E-commerce website which is used to sell fashion items. We get to see all the tech giants indulging constantly in their company websites to increase their customer satisfaction and thereby increasing their revenue. Everything mentioned above is possible only when the websites are met with customer satisfaction. This project uses React, Redux, Firebase and many tools which makes the website easier for the customers to handle and ofcourse easy for our servers to handle as well.

I think this is a cool project, Here's why:

<ul>
  <li> This project is scalable and very light which adds to its advantage of being awesome.</li>
  <li> The state of the website on a cusstomers machine is saved in a single file because of the usage of redux which makes rendering of pages very light and easy.</li>
  <li> This project is made keeping in mind the concept of reusable components, which makes the code reusable in other projects as components.</li>
</ul>
